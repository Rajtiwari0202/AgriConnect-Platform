# Agricultural Platform - "AgriConnect"

## Project Overview
A comprehensive Indian agricultural platform connecting tenant farmers with landowners featuring economic data integration, government schemes awareness, national subscription pricing, Stripe India payment processing, and farmer-friendly affordability models.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Wouter routing, ShadCN UI components, TailwindCSS, Recharts for data visualization
- **Backend**: Express.js with enhanced in-memory storage, security middleware (Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with Passport.js, session management with secure secrets
- **Payments**: Stripe India integration with UPI/Card/NetBanking, simulated escrow via manual capture
- **Economic Dashboard**: Government budget data, farm income analysis, affordability calculations
- **Government Integration**: PM-KISAN, PMFBY, KCC schemes with real application links
- **Security**: Environment validation with Zod, production-grade middleware stack
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Indian localization (en-IN, INR currency)

## Core Features - Enhanced
1. **User Management**: KYC verification, Aadhaar/PAN integration, subscription tiers
2. **Land Listings**: Comprehensive agricultural specifications (soil, irrigation, crops, legal docs)
3. **National Subscription Plans**: Farmer-affordable pricing based on economic data (â‚¹99-â‚¹1999/month)
4. **Payment System**: Stripe India with escrow protection, recurring subscriptions, invoice generation
5. **Economic Dashboard**: Union Budget data, income analysis, platform metrics, affordability calculator
6. **Government Schemes**: PM-KISAN, PMFBY, KCC integration with application guidance
7. **Enhanced Messaging**: Threaded conversations, file attachments, read receipts
8. **Security**: Environment validation, rate limiting, JWT authentication, role-based access

## Data Models - Comprehensive
- **Enhanced User**: KYC status, farming experience, FPO membership, subscription management
- **Enhanced Listing**: Soil specifications, irrigation details, legal documentation, crop suitability
- **Tenancy Requests**: Contract terms, escrow integration, status workflow
- **Payment Records**: Multi-purpose tracking (subscription, deposit, rent, commission)
- **Escrow Management**: Simulated holding via Stripe manual capture
- **Government Schemes**: Official data with application processes and deadlines
- **Economic Metrics**: Dashboard analytics and historical data tracking

## National Subscription Plans
- **Basic Plan**: â‚¹99/month - Smallholder farmers (< 2 acres) - â‰ˆ1.2% of avg income
- **Pro Plan**: â‚¹499/month - Mid-scale farms (2-10 acres) - â‰ˆ2.0% of avg income  
- **Enterprise Plan**: â‚¹1999/month - Large operations (> 10 acres) - â‰ˆ2.7% of avg income

## User Preferences
- TypeScript end-to-end with comprehensive type safety
- INR currency with "en-IN" locale throughout the platform
- Farmer-friendly explanations and government scheme integration
- Security-first approach with environment validation
- Comprehensive economic data integration for transparency
- Production-grade architecture with proper error handling
