## PRICING & REVENUE MODEL
- Farmers pay **variable service fee** based on state average crop income—e.g:
  - Punjab: ₹X/month  
  - Bihar: ₹Y/month (lower)  
  - Offer subsidized/reduced rate for marginal states.  
- Deduct a platform commission of **5–10%** on rentals and deposit payments (clearly stated in T&C).  
- Include subscription tiers:
  - **Basic**: For marginal farmers, low fee.  
  - **Standard**: Default nationwide.  
  - **Premium**: Add value services (chat analytics, priority listing) priced higher.  
- Enforce dynamic pricing logic in backend (`SubscriptionPlan` model + `pricingCalculator(region, cropType, MSP, GDP, profitMargin)`).  
- All values in ₹ (INR), displayed with `Intl.NumberFormat("en-IN", ...)`.

## PRODUCTS & FINANCIAL FLOWS
- Use **Stripe India** with currency `inr`, UPI, netbanking, card payments. Amounts in paise (₹500 → 50000).  
- Tenant makes deposit (via Stripe Checkout), held in escrow. On acceptance, landlord receives payment minus commission.  
- Subscription payments auto-renew monthly (Stripe subscription) with region-based tiers.  
- Display projected annual subscription cost, compare to average farmer income to demonstrate affordability.  
- Generate a profitability dashboard: platform revenue projections vs user income levels.

## LEGAL & UX DETAILS
- Generate **Terms & Conditions** and **Consent forms**:
  - Explain pricing, commissions, refunds, subscription auto-renewal, regional price differences, data usage, dispute resolution.  
- At signup, require acknowledgment via checkbox: “I agree to the T&C and pricing based on my region.”  
- Show tooltips with real-time stats (“Your estimated annual income: ₹XX, our fee: ₹YY — that’s Z% of income, aligned with national average”).

## FRONTEND & UX DESIGN
- Clean, modern UI with dark/light mode toggle.  
- Data-rich dashboards for farmers showing economics and projections.  
- Info pages: “How we calculate your monthly fee — based on national income, MSP, regional GDP, and your state.”  
- Animations (Framer Motion) for smooth onboarding and pricing tooltips.  
- Accessibility compliance (ARIA, keyboard nav).

---

## DEVOPS & QA
- CI Workflow: lint, tests, build (GitHub Actions).  
- ESLint + Prettier enforced.  
- Seed data including realistic subscriber plans (Punjab, Bihar, UP) with MSP/crop income values.  
- README explaining industry-specific context (India GVA, budget schemes), how pricing was modeled, and deployment instructions.

---

## FINAL DELIVERABLE
- Fully runnable project code in Replit structure (client + server + configs).  
- Pricing logic in plain-language comments referenced to government data, /docs; accurate T&C, responsive UI.  
- Metrics in dashboards: platform revenue vs farmer income; disclaimer referencing Economic Survey & Budget 2025.
